This course is an end-to-end project which provides you with real organizational experience and business knowledge. Through the course, I have built a dashboard for Atliq hardware company which will provide insights to the respective team in the organization to make data-driven decisions.

Problem Statement:
Atliq manufactures computer hardware and components they established themselves in the market and substantially grew in the last few years, they tried to develop their own store in Latin America but faced a huge loss and realized the reason was a decision made on some survey conducted. In the annual strategic meeting, atliq decided to hire a data analytical team to make data-driven decisions, and bring transparency into data.
